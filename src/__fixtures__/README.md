It is unfortunately very difficult to acquire free images with metadata as metadata is often stripped from images when they are uploaded to the web. To best test real-world use, I have attempted to find images that are in the public domain or have a permissive license. The following images are used in the tests:

1. [T-45A Goshawk](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:T-45A_Goshawk_03.jpg) - Lt. Cmdr. John A. Ivancic, USN

This image was released by the United States Navy with the ID [080604-N-2798I-002](https://web.archive.org/web/20200505120013/https://www.navy.mil/view_image.asp?id=59981). As "a work prepared by an officer or employee of the United States Government as part of that person's official duties," it is in the public domain ([17 U.S.C. ยง 105](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/105)). The photograph was taken by Lt. Cmdr. John A. Ivancic, a U.S. Navy officer.
